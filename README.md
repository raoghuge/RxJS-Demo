# RxJS Polling + State Management Using RxJS + Custom Theming + Observables

#1: Create a long polling with Rxjs. Detect when online will start polling, when offline stop polling. (Subscribe change online/offline using rxjs. Write a function called getOnlineStatus(): Observable<boolean>)

#2: Detect when a user is online and logged in using rxjs. Write a log “User is online and logged in” (online/offline status is used from above test. There is an observable called isUserLoggedIn$ will return value user is online true/false)

#3: You have a function getNumber(): Observable<number>, It uses a Subject myNumber$ that adds a random number every 500ms. Please write a code to get list of number from that function when there is change each 2s (Please use rxjs)

#4: Writing a code that get value from one input on change and use that value for a function called searchMessages(keyword: string): Observable<Message[]> 
When we receive data from that function. Please display the messages list in the UI using change detection

#5: Please provide your approach to setup a multiple themes structure and build the app with multiple themes and allow user to change any theme in the list we provided

#6: Writing a sample code using state management. That has Conversation and Message models. One Conversation can contain many messages
